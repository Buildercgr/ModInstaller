# ModInstaller User Guide

Welcome to **ModInstaller**! This guide will help you understand how to use the tool to install Minecraft mods easily across platforms.

---

## Getting Started

To begin, run the `modInstaller` file included in this folder. Depending on your operating system, the file may have one of the following formats:

- `.exe` for **Windows**  
- `.app` for **macOS**
- `.appImage` for **Linux**

Once launched, the ModInstaller window will appear with several options. One of the key fields is the **Minecraft mods folder**, which is where all selected mods will be installed.

## Installing Mods via Modrinth

To install mods directly from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com), click the **"Search mods on Modrinth"** button. A new interface will open where you can:

- Enter your **Minecraft version** (e.g. `1.20.1`)
- Specify your **mod loader** (e.g. `forge`, `fabric`, `neoforge`)

After entering your criteria and pressing Enter, a list of compatible mods will appear. You can search for specific mods and install them with a single click.

> This feature is currently in beta and may contain bugs. If you encounter issues, we recommend installing the mod manually using its `.jar` file and reporting the problem via GitHub Issues.

## Installing Mods via `.jar` Files

This feature allows you to install mods manually using `.jar` files. It's ideal if a mod fails to install via Modrinth or comes from another platform.

To install mods this way:

1. Click **"Select .jar files"** from the main menu.
2. Choose the `.jar` files you want to install.
3. Click **"Install mods from 'mods' folder"** to complete the installation.
